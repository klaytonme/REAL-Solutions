						<h3>Clothing that Wears the Planet Back (Like Wears Down... I Know)</h3>
						<h4>Fashion is a problem.</h4>
						<p style="text-indent: 2em">The cycle of fast fashion, buying new clothes cheaply, abundantly, and frequently are taking its toll on our planet. Microplastics from synthetic clothing fibers get stuck in the ocean, unable to break down. The fashion industry accounts for 10% of annual global carbon emissions. Making one pair of jeans produces the same amount of greenhouse gasses as driving 80 miles in a car. Beyond carbon emissions, they are also responsible for creating 20% of the world’s wastewater, through processes like dyeing and treating fabric.</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 2em">So, what can you do to help? First, you can buy less clothes. Buy clothes that you need, and will wear often, not items you think you want but will be worn once before being forgotten in the back of your closet. Next, you can buy used or thrifted clothing. This will reduce the amount of clothing that goes to landfills, and your money won’t be supporting businesses that are unsustainably polluting the environment. Finally, you can buy clothing from sustainable brands, such as People Tree or Patagonia.</p>
						<p style="text-indent: 2em">If you’re interested in reducing your carbon emissions by buying less clothes, consider taking a pledge! Click here to sign this pledge committing to buying less new clothes!</p>

								<h5>Buy Clothing That Has Been Used Before</h5>
								<p>Clothing from thrift stores or consignment shops reduces your clothing footprint enormously. In addition, a lot of thrift shops like Good Will can help move your money that you need to spend on clothing toward making the world a better place.</p>

								<h5>Do Some Research First</h5>
								<p>Before buying the new clothing that you can't get by thrifting, research brands to see if their environmental practices are in-line with your beliefs. While this takes a little more work, it is a good way to show fashion brands that if they don't care about our planet, we don't care about their products. We endorce People Tree and Patagonia as a starting point</p>
