						<h3>The Deets on Meat</h3>
						<h4>Meat is a problem.</h4>
						<p style="text-indent: 2em">If everyone in the United States stopped eating meat and cheese for one day a week, it would be like taking 7.6 million cars off the road. Meat is responsible for approximately 56.6% of greenhouse gases produced in the average diet. Growing beef requires 20 times as much land and produces 20 times as much carbon emissions as beans per gram of protein. Reducing meat consumption is a key part of reducing your personal carbon footprint! </p>
						<p style="text-indent: 2em">So what can you do? One way you can help is by eating meats that produce less greenhouse gasses– for example, switching from beef to chicken. Another way you can reduce your carbon emissions is by eating less meat each week. Even going meatless for one day a week can significantly reduce your carbon footprint! Beyond that, you can opt to go permanently vegetarian, or find vegetarian alternatives to some of your favorite recipes. Other dietary changes that will help reduce carbon emissions are to buy your food locally! Locally grown foods don’t have to be shipped as far, so it doesn’t take as much carbon dioxide to get to your dinner table. Similarly, try buying food that’s in season locally, so it doesn’t have to be shipped over long distances because local area farms can’t grow it. </p>
						<p style="text-indent: 2em">If you’re interested in reducing your carbon footprint by making changes to your diet, consider taking a Meatless Monday pledge! Click here to sign this pledge committing to not eating meat for one day a week!
